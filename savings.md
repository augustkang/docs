# Savings

The Savings page provides miscellaneous functionality to help you use resources more effectively and assess wasteful spending.

By default, the Savings page and any displayed metrics (Estimated monthly savings available, for example) will apply to all connected clusters. You can change this by selecting the dropdown in the top right, then selecting an individual cluster.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Functionality for most cloud insight features only exists when _All Clusters_ is selected in the cluster dropdown. Individual clusters will usually only have access to Kubernetes insight features.
