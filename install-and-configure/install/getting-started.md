# Getting Started

This doc provides commonly used product configurations and feature overviews to help get you up and running after the Kubecost product has been [installed](https://kubecost.com/install).

## Overview

There are many methods to set up Kubecost. A simple Helm install will provide most functionality to understand what Kubecost can do. When you do not pass any values to the Helm install, many of the custom options below are available in _Settings_.

By default, Kubecost will detect the cloud provider where it is installed and pull list prices for nodes, storage, and LoadBalancers on Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## Setting up a cloud integration <a href="#cloud-integration" id="cloud-integration"></a>

While the basic Helm install is useful for understanding the value Kubecost provides, most will want to deploy with an infrastructure as code (IaC) model. There are many methods to provide Kubecost with the necessary service accounts or privileges needed. Kubecost has separate documents for cloud integration with each major cloud service provider.

By completing the cloud integration with each provider, Kubecost is able to reconcile costs with your actual cloud bill to reflect enterprise discounts, Spot market prices, commitment discounts, and more.

Cloud integration also enables the ability to view Kubernetes cost metrics side-by-side with external cloud services costs, such as S3, BigQuery, and Azure Database Services.

For Kubecost Enterprise plans, cloud integration is only run on the primary cluster. The file is a .JSON array where multiple accounts and providers can be configured.

## Additional considerations

{% hint style="info" %}
The remaining sections are optional and may be useful for specific use cases.
{% endhint %}

### Memory and storage

The default Kubecost installation has a 32Gb persistent volume and a 15-day retention period for Prometheus metrics. This is enough space to retain data for roughly 300 pods, depending on your exact node and container count. See the Kubecost Helm chart [configuration options](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart) to adjust both the retention period and storage size.

To determine the appropriate disk size, you can use this formula to approximate:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
needed_disk_space = retention_time_minutes * ingested_samples_per_minutes * bytes_per_sample
```
{% endcode %}

Where ingested samples can be measured as the average over a recent period, e.g. `sum(avg_over_time(scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling[24h]))`. On average, Prometheus uses around 1.5-2 bytes per sample. So, ingesting 100k samples per minute and retaining them for 15 days would demand around 40 GB. Itâ€™s recommended to add another 20-30% capacity for headroom and WAL. More info on disk sizing [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects).

{% hint style="warning" %}
More than 30 days of data should not be stored in Prometheus for larger clusters. For long-term data retention, contact us at support@kubecost.com about Kubecost with durable storage enabled. [More info on Kubecost storage here](../../storage.md).
{% endhint %}

### More configuration

<details>

<summary><strong>Configuring Kubecost during installation</strong></summary>

Kubecost has a number of product configuration options that you can specify at install time in order to minimize the number of settings changes required within the product UI. This makes it simple to redeploy Kubecost. These values can be configured under `kubecostProductConfigs` in our [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/bb8bcb570e6c52db2ed603f69691ac8a47ff4a26/cost-analyzer/values.yaml#L335). These parameters are passed to a ConfigMap that Kubecost detects and writes to its /var/configs.

<details>

<summary><strong>Setting requests and limits</strong></summary>

Users should set and/or update resource requests and limits before taking Kubecost into production at scale. These inputs can be configured in the Kubecost [values.yaml](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/master/cost-analyzer/values.yaml) for Kubecost modules and subcharts.

The exact recommended values for these parameters depend on the size of your cluster, availability requirements, and usage of the Kubecost product. Suggested values for each container can be found within Kubecost itself on the namespace page. More info on these recommendations is available [here](https://blog.kubecost.com/blog/requests-and-limits/).

For best results, run Kubecost for up to seven days on a production cluster, then tune resource requests/limits based on resource consumption.

<details>

<summary><strong>Using an existing node exporter</strong></summary>

For teams already running node exporter on the default port, our bundled node exporter may remain in a `Pending` state. You can optionally use an existing node exporter DaemonSet by setting the `prometheus.nodeExporter.enabled` and `prometheus.serviceAccounts.nodeExporter.create` Kubecost Helm chart config options to `false`. This requires your existing node exporter endpoint to be visible from the namespace where Kubecost is installed. More configs options shown [here](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart).

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Deploying Kubecost without persistent volumes</strong></summary>

You may optionally pass the following Helm flags to install Kubecost and its bundled dependencies without any persistent volumes. However, any time the Prometheus server pod is restarted, **all historical billing data will be lost** unless Thanos or other long-term storage is enabled in the Kubecost product.

```
--set prometheus.alertmanager.persistentVolume.enabled=false
--set prometheus.pushgateway.persistentVolume.enabled=false
--set prometheus.server.persistentVolume.enabled=false
--set persistentVolume.enabled=false
```
